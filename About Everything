About Us:
We are students of Georgia State Univerity. 
The joint efforts of a dynamic team consisting of  Yulduz Muradova, Jamie Lopez, Mark Denina, Osagiede John Osemwengie, and Vimeth Jayawardana are evident in EggCrypt. Our team, driven by a common interest in security and innovation, is setting out to rethink the conventional wisdom around password systems. At EggCrypt, we think ordinary security measures should be transformed into interactive, user-empowering experiences.

About EggCrypt:
With EggCrypt, password systems are approached in a whole new way that combines user engagement and security. 
Users are sent to an entertaining and secure environment when they choose an image from our website. 
The selected image is transformed, breaking up into nine disorganized fragments, giving users an engaging challenge to solve. 
By navigating through the disorganized components, users actively contribute to strengthening their own digital security in addition to gaining access. 
EggCrypt aims to transform the way people engage with password systems, making security both user-friendly and entertaining, rather than only protecting data.
